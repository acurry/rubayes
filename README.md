# rubayes
A naive Bayes document classifier in Ruby. Built against Ruby 1.9.2.

## inspired by:
http://blog.saush.com/2009/02/11/naive-bayesian-classifiers-and-ruby/

## what?
A naive Bayes classifier is a tool used to classify documents as a certain
category based on the words in the document.

Currently I'm working on using redis for document persistence.

## why?
I made this to learn about Bayes classification and probability calculation.
